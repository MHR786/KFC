        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders, who started selling his
          fried chicken recipe from a roadside restaurant in Kentucky. The
          iconic "finger-lickin' good" taste quickly gained popularity, leading
          to the establishment of the first official KFC restaurant in 1952.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, KFC has grown into a global brand with thousands of locations
          worldwide. Despite our growth, we remain committed to Colonel Sanders'
          original recipe and the values that have made KFC a household name.
